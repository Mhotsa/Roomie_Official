<h1>Personal Life</h1>
<h3>Berghult was born and raised in Gothenburg, Sweden.[4] His father, Bosse Berghult, is also a musician and had encouraged his musical endeavors growing up by providing him with instruments and music production software.[1]

Berghult graduated in 2014 from Musikmakarna [sv], where he studied songwriting and music production.[5] Berghult moved to the United Kingdom in 2015.[4]</h3>
<h1>Career</h1>
<h3>Berghult started his YouTube channel in 2010.[3][6] In 2014, he rose to prominence by uploading a series of celebrity singer impressions.[7][8][9] The first of which was titled "One Guy, 14 Voices" which became one of Berghult's first of many viral videos.[10][11] The next year Berghult released a follow up "One Guy, 15 Voices" in August 2015.[12][13] He was subsequently invited to perform on Nyhetsmorgon in September 2015,[14] followed by Good Morning America that October.[15] The most recent of the series, released in 2017 is "One Guy, 43 Voices (with music)" which has over 91 million views and is Berghult's most viewed video as of December 2020.[16]

In 2014, Berghult began to release music with fellow Swedish YouTuber PewDiePie (who is also from Gothenburg). The single "His Name is Pewdiepie" was released in 2014 and was made using samples of PewDiePie's voice;[6] later that year, "Fabulous" was released, followed by "Brofist" in 2016. In 2019, Berghult again teamed up with PewDiePie and longtime collaborator Boyinaband on the song "Congratulations".[17][18] The song peaked at number one on the US Comedy Digital Track Sales published by Billboard.[19]

At the start of 2020, Berghult began uploading videos daily onto his channel, with a greater emphasis on commentary, Reddit, and other fan-created videos as well as covers. However, on 11 June 2020, Berghult announced a break from creating videos, stating that daily uploads were tiring and prevented him from producing bigger projects and that he would be scaling back to five videos a week on his return.[20] On 20 July 2020, while still on break, Berghult released an album single "Livin' For That" on Spotify under the handle Lil Pitchy. The album consists of the song "Livin' For That", plus its instrumental and acapella versions.[21]
